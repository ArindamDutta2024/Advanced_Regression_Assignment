## General Information
- Provide general information about your project here.

- What is the background of your project?
> A US-based housing company named Surprise Housing has decided to enter the Australian market.
> The company uses data analytics to purchase houses at a price below their actual values and flip them on at a higher price.

- What is the business problem that your project is trying to solve?
> The company is looking at prospective properties to buy to enter the market.
> You are required to build a regression model using regularisation in order to predict the actual value of the prospective properties   and decide whether to invest in them or not.
> The company wants to know:
>Which variables are significant in predicting the price of a house, and
> How well those variables describe the price of a house.
Also, determine the optimal value of lambda for ridge and lasso regression.

- What is the dataset that is being used?
> Data Set is available in a CSV file named train.csv

- Objective of the Project?
> You are required to model the price of houses with the available independent variables.
> This model will then be used by the management to understand how exactly the prices vary with the variables.
> They can accordingly manipulate the strategy of the firm and concentrate on areas that will yield high returns.
> Further, the model will be a good way for management to understand the pricing dynamics of a new market.

- Approach to solve this business problem
> Step 1 : Data Understanding and Exploratory Data Analysis ( EDA )
> Step 2 : Data Preperation
> Step 3 : Training the model
> Step 4 : Model Prediction and Evaluation
> Step 5 : Redge and Lasso Regularization
> Step 6 : Conclusions and Results
